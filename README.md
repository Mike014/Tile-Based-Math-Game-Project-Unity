## Overview

This repository contains a **Unity 2D practice project** developed to experiment with **animation systems and gameplay mechanics**.
The project was used as a learning sandbox rather than a finished product.

## Learning Focus

The main goals of this project were to:

* Build a basic **2D player controller**
* Work with the **Animator** and animation state machines
* Handle **player states** and physics-based movement
* Prototype **object pooling** and obstacle spawning
* Set up simple **UI elements** and time-based mechanics
